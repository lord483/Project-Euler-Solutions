Problem 39-Integer right triangles

If p is the perimeter of a right angle triangle with integral length sides, {a,b,c}, there are exactly three solutions for p = 120.

{20,48,52}, {24,45,51}, {30,40,50}

For which value of p â‰¤ 1000, is the number of solutions maximised?    '''

maxs = 0
maxn = 0
'''
If both a and b are even, c will also be even and P (the perimeter) will be even.
If both a and b are odd, c will be even and P will be even.
If one is even and the other is odd, c will be odd and P will again be even.
Therefore, only even values of P need to be checked.  '''
